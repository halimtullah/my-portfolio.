                <h4> <span class="h4">Hi I'm Halima.</span></h4>
                <p> My name is <em>Halima,</em> I live in <em>Nairobi Kenya</em> -the City under the Sun. <br> 
                    I would love to specialize in <em>responsive web development, UI/UX design, and visual development,</em> 
                    because the future lies in tech. </p>
