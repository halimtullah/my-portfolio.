                <p> My name is Halima, I live in Nairobi Kenya -the City under the Sun. <br> 
                    I would love to specialize in responsive web development, UI/UX design, and visual development, 
                    because the future lies in tech.

                <P> I have a passion in Teaching, which was recently validated by a friend in Moringa School. My goal is among other things to join Moringa School as a Technical Mentor.</P>
