                    I would love to specialize in responsive web development, UI/UX design, and visual development, 
                    because the future lies in tech. 
                </p>
                <p> I would like to use my tech knowledge and experiences to solve a problem within the society, I believe African problems should be solved by Africans.</p>
                <P> I have a passion in Teaching, which was recently validated by a friend in Moringa School. My goal is among other things to join Moringa School as a Technical Mentor.</P>
