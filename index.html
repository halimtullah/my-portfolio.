            <h4> <span class="h4">Hi I'm Halima.</span></h4>
            <p> My name is <em>Halima,</em> I live in <em>Nairobi Kenya</em> -the City under the Sun.<br> 
                   <br> I would love to specialize in <em>responsive web development, UI/UX design, and visual development,</em> 
                    because the future lies in tech. </p>
            <p> I have a degree from Greenwhich University in Business Management. </p>
            <p> I would like to use my tech knowledge and experiences to solve a problem within our society. <br> 
                    <br>I believe African problems should be solved by Africans.</p>
            <P> I have a passion in Teaching and mentoring; which was recently validated by a friend in Moringa School. 
                    My goal is among other things to join Moringa School as a Technical Mentor.</P>
            <p> Here is a link of project I created while in Moringa School. </p>
        <p>Check out <a href="https://halimtullah.github.io/smart-island/"> Smart Resort Island.</a> 
            It describe the Smart Island Resort and it's magnificient attributes.</p>
        
        <p> In smart-resort-island I used the following languages: </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li> HTML</li>
            <li> CSS</li>
        </ul>

            <p> My hobbies are Cycling although not explored well, I love marathon and hope to run half marathon someday.</p>
            <p> I am also a member of Nairobi Toastmaster, I am on a journey of self improvement and self development.</p>
            <p> I live by two <strong>mantras</strong> which are; <em>life begins at the end of your comfort zone and never rest never settle!</em></p>
